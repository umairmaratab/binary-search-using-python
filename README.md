# Binray Search
## A divide and conquer algorithm
It helps you search an ordered list faster, searches a list using divide and conquer strategy and if number finds it returns its index.

# Working:
It asks the root that is element = root, if yes return it's index, if != and element < root then go to left side of tree, if != and element > root go to right side of tree.

## Difference b/w Naive Search and Binary Search
**Naive Search** scans entire list and ask if it's equal to target if yes return index, if no return -1
**Binary Search** divides list into half on each recursive call and so we get huge speed boost.
